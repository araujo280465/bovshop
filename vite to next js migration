I'm glad everything looks good! The migration to Next.js 13+ is now complete with all components properly structured. Here's a quick summary of what we've accomplished:
Created reusable components in src/components/:
LoteList.jsx
ClienteList.jsx
UsuarioList.jsx
Home.jsx
About.jsx
Set up Next.js pages in src/app/ with proper routing:
/ → Home page
/lotes → Lotes list
/clientes → Clientes list
/usuarios → Usuários list
/sobre → About page
Added proper client-side handling:
Added 'use client' directive to all components
Used dynamic imports with ssr: false for client-side components
Maintained all existing functionality while improving the architecture
Cleaned up by removing old files from src/pages/
The application should now be running with Next.js's modern app directory structure while maintaining all the existing functionality. You can start the development server with npm run dev to test everything out.
Is there anything specific you'd like me to explain or any other improvements you'd like to make to the application?
